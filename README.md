## Description

This application is designed to allow employers to search for users within GitHub as potential employee candidates. An employer can then cycle through single candidates until they find somebody of interest, who they can then add to a second page of saved candidates.

## Installation

To install this app, be sure to copy the code from the Repository and run the command `npm run i` to install the required dependencies and run the command `npm run dev` to start the Vite server.

## Usage

On the candidate search page, a single GitHub candidate is listed. The minus button at the bottom allows an empoyer to skip that current candidate and display a different random candidate. Pressing the plus button saves that candidate to the saved candidates page and then displays another random candidate. Navigating to the saved candidates page at the top will display all of the GitHub candidates that an employer has saved. Clicking the red x button at the bottom of a candidate will remove that user from the saved candidates page.
